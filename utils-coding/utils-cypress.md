# Cypress

## Notes

- the difference between the then() and the within(). then() allows you to do imperative/js on the get element itself while the within() is in the elements inside the get
- the difference between the within() and find():  within() allows you to do imperative/js and the find is classic chaining

note: you can also use then then() to trigger a function that use the cypress chaining, similar to a command but inside a function
