## COMMON STRATEGY
- long only
- long/short
- trend following (suivi de tendance)
- mean reversion (retour Ã  la moyenne) for instance when standard deviation > 2 or 3 then we are going to have a mean reversion to the MA

## FILTER STRATEGY
- detect the asset to focus on for a swing (3 days to 30 days)
- the best TA pattern
- the best risk/rewards ratio
- take position and wait confirmation

## CRYPTO STRATEGY
- sell at resistance and get usd or the other pair
- sell only 25% / 50% and divide in many other main assets: usd, btc, eth
- buy at support with the other currency 
- keep 10% of the portfolio in usd to buy the dips
- buy at the sound of the cannon sell at the sound of the violin
- place order at low price in usd(x) pairs with low liquidity

## INDICATORS

21 EMA DAILY

## Strat 1
- bullish if price is above the weelkly 21 MA (if it hold above it's bullish)
- bullish if price is bellow the weelkly 21 MA (if it hold below it's bearish)
- adx is below 20 then it's a ranging cycle (choppy)
- adx is above 20 then it's a trending cycle (directionnal)

## Strat 2
- When RSI goes below 45 on a daily timeframe it's bearish. (below 30 hyper bearish but also expect big reverse)
- When RSI goes above 55 on a daily timeframe it's bullish. (above 70 hyper bullish but also expect big reverse)
