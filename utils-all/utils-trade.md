## RULES

- Follow long term trendline and close winning trade on a resitance trend line and rebuy if breakout appear.
- Close winning especially if you are surexposed, you can also close to do a rotation.
- Backtest & Follow your indicator.
- Place your stop loss at entry point
- Minimum time market buy stop & quick take profit 
- Manage risk according to current volatily: 

## COMMON STRATEGY
- long only
- long/short
- trend following
- mean reversion for instance when standard deviation > 2 or 3 then we are going to have a mean reversion to the MA

## STOP LOSS/EXIT
- gradual approach in reducing their position. If it’s a momentum trade they put the max size on and reduce gradually as the trade moves against them

## FILTER STRATEGY
- detect the asset to focus on for a swing (3 days to 30 days)
- the best TA pattern
- the best risk/rewards ratio
- take position and wait confirmation

## CRYPTO STRATEGY
- sell at resistance and get usd or the other pair
- sell only 25% / 50% and divide in many other main assets: usd, btc, eth
- buy at support with the other currency 
- keep 10% of the portfolio in usd to buy the dips
- buy at the sound of the cannon sell at the sound of the violin
- place order at low price in usd(x) pairs with low liquidity
- rise duration is between 40 and 60 days and 10 to 14 are parabolic
- then we have a range

## LEVERAGE

- leveraged position can be used only after a big correction like minus 30% and use only a small leverage such as x2 or x3, it will helps reduce your stress.

## INDICATORS

21 EMA DAILY

## Rsi:
- bullish if price is above the weelkly 21 MA (if it hold above it's bullish)
- bullish if price is bellow the weelkly 21 MA (if it hold below it's bearish)
- adx is below 20 then it's a ranging cycle (choppy)
- adx is above 20 then it's a trending cycle (directionnal)

## Strat: Rsi
- When RSI goes below 45 on a daily timeframe it's bearish. (below 30 hyper bearish but also expect big reverse)
- When RSI goes above 55 on a daily timeframe it's bullish. (above 70 hyper bullish but also expect big reverse)

## Strat: bollinger bands: width

Buys when Band Width reaches 20-day low and EMA1 > EMA2.
Shorts when Band Width reaches 20-day low and EMA1 < EMA2.
Exits position when EMA reverses.

## Strat: bollinger bands: breakout

Buy/short when price moves outside of the inner band (m1).
Exit when the price moves into the inner band or to the outer bound (m2).

## Strat: Vix
- buy SP500 when VIX closes above 30 and sell when VIX closes below 20. = +25% in 2022
- buy SP500 when VIX closes below 20 and sell when VIX closes above 30. = -33% in 2022

## Strat: MA200
- 

## INFLATION/DEFLATION
- when bonds are crashing then interest rates are rising => we are going towards inflation
- when bonds are rising then interest rates are crashing => we are going towards deflation

## VOLATILITY
- when the volatility is high it's risky so just do day-trading and secure gain after few hours
- when the volatility is low it's safe so just do swing-trading and secure gain after few days

## MOMENTUM

Momentum is the speed or velocity of price changes in a stock, security, or tradable instrument.

## TREND
- bull market usually takes many years (24 months to 72 months)
- bear market usually takes few months (8 months to 18 months)
- you can make more money in bear (assets falls 7 times faster than they rise)
- then you have a lot of money to buy the bottom with simple technical analysis
- you can focus on stock which offers a very good dividends (7/10 percents)

## DUMB MONEY
- they usually do trend following strategy and the issue arises when they become so confident that they establish their largest long positions after markets have rallied hard and their smallest after markets have declined. so they are most exposed at the peak and the least at the bottom. we can also call ignorant money.

## GAPS

- gap downs have a higher proba of filling than gap ups
- gap on individual stocks are not good for trading
- gap on indices are good for trading, much more probability

## INDICATOR
- correlation: helps to be more accurate and eliminate false signals: gold/silver | gdx/sil | btc/eth | s&p/nasdaq
- forces: longer it remains near support the more dangerous it becomes
- ratio: rendement potentiel / risque (Sharpe et Sortino)
- diversification: reduction risque

## TAKE PROFIT

- short models turns flat if SP500 fall > -9% during the past 3 sessions.
- long models turns flat if SP500 rise > x% during the past 3 sessions.

## RANGE

- ADX < X (like 25) / MMI (Market Meanness Index) / Momersion indicator / MA slope
- If volatility is low, don't trade. Measure it as low ATR or narrow BB bands width etc

- https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-way-to-reduce-whipsaws-in-a-moving-average-based-trading-system

## WHIPSAWS

The classic moving average is generating a lot of whipsaws so you can add an extra filter to get rid of these false signals.

- Ranging: The market is ranging you can ignore the signal to avoid the whipsaw.
- Extent: The price has to surpass an additional upper band & lower band in order to trigger the signal, the upper and lower can be generated using different ways: adding x percent of the moving average (ex: Percentage Price Oscillator) or the moving average of the high/low. It can also be a classic bollinger band, an enveloppe or a keltner channel. Another solution is to have x percent of some other measure, such as the trading range (high/low) of the past y days.
- Extreme sentiment: In an uptrend crossover, the low has to surpass the moving average and not just the close; in a downtrend, the high has to be under the moving average, and not just the close.
- Time: The close has to remain above (or below) the moving average for an additional x number of periods after the crossover date.
- Volume: The crossover has to be accompanied by a significant rise in volume.
- Smoothing: The shortest the moving average you use the more you will have whipsaws. so in this case you can smooth your signal by adding a first very short moving average (5 period) to the price and then calculate your initial moving average using this smoothed one.

## RISK MANAGEMENT
- measure the risk before an entry: % Distance from long MA. Could also be high ATR, bands etc.

## OBV

Everyone uses the RSI, but most people are sleeping on the OBV. Bad idea. OBV divergences and support/resistance are more reliable than on the RSI and it's breakout often precede price breakout.

## FRACTALE

- when the trend is positive on many timeframes (at least 3): m15,h1,h4,d,w,m
